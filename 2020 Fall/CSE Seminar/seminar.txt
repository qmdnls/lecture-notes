# less than 100 words
In this talk the speaker presents results and backgrounds for two papers that deal with dialogue systems. The first paper presented, after reviewing related work, focuses on improving the consistency in dialogue models: agents often will forget important details talked about as they attend to reply with the most likely answer in a context. By using an imaginary listener that forces the dialogue system to keep its persona this can be overcome. The second paper focuses on integrating knowledge into dialogue. He presents a sequential latent model for knowledge selection in dialogue (sequential knowledge transformer). 


    Two papers:

    - Improve consistency of dialogue models without annotated training
        - Consistency problem in dialogue agents: agents will forget important details already talked about as they tend to reply with the most likely answer for a given context so there can be inconsistencies throughout the dialogue
        - Reviewing previous works tackling consistency in dialogue
        - Look at consistency from the view point of humans: we control our own consistency, we are aware of ourselves.
        - Idea: use an imaginary listener

    - Knowledge-grounded dialogue:
        - Sequential latent model for knowledge selection in dialogue
        - How do we know which knowledge to select from all the available knowledge?
        - Difficulty: rather than a single fact, many known facts may be relevant for the answer as well as the dialog history
        - Sequential Knowledge Transformer: knowledge selectrion treated as a 

Strong Points:
# less than 100 words
The talk was well-prepared and had very clear and concise slides. The speaker explained everything very clearly and in detail which understanding the material better. Relevant prior work was reviewed. Overall, the speaker presented interesting contributions to an interesting topic.

- Nice slides, clear explanations, review of relevant prior work, interesting topic with interesting contributions


Weak Points:
Unfortunately, the time management was not great so most of the talk focused on the first paper and the speaker began to run out of time by the time he started on the second paper. Due to this the presentation for this second paper felt a bit rushed and no details were given or explained beyond the basic idea.

    Poor time management, no details on second paper

Title : 부채널 정보 기반 암호해독 기법 소개

Abstract:
In spite of the common assumption made during the design of many cryptosystems, secrets are not manipulated in closed and reliable computing environments. Instead, existing hardware may leak information about operations which can be used to retrieve the secrets under certain circumstances. Such an attack is known as a side-channel attack. In this talk the speaker gives a historic overview over how such attacks have developed over the past two decades and gives some concrete examples of them. Lastly, the speaker explains some potential counter-measures against side-channel attacks.

    - in spite of assumptions made during creation of many cryptosystems, secrets are not manipulated in closed, reliable computing environemnts. existing hardware leaks information about operations that may be used to retrieve the circuits under certain circumstances. this is called a side-channel attack.
    - analysing external factors during cryptographic computations
    - overview over the history of side-channel attacks and their development over the past two decades
    - explanation of counter-measures

Strong Points:
The talk included a nice and useful overview over the history which I thought added some valuable background information. The speaker included many visualizations which helped better the understanding of the topic. Overall I found the presentation easy to follow as the speaker gave intuitive explanations of the intricacies of side-channel attacks and included many good examples which helped aid understanding (along with the visualizations mentioned).

    # less than 100 words
    - overview over the history
    - many visualizations
    - easy to follow, intuitive explanations of the intricacies of side-channel attacks, good examples that aid understanding

Weak Points:
The presentation start ended being delayed to some technical problems unfortunately and there was not really any communication to the people following along on Zoom as to what was going on. Once the presentation had started these issues seemed to have been resolved however. Additionally, the slides were not very appealing visually and looked rather dated; although they included many visualizations.

Title : [AI 콜로퀴움] Machine Musicianship: When AI meets music

Speaker : Kyogu Lee

Abstract:
In this talk the speaker introduces various tasks related to sound and music such as music identification, musical source separation, machine musicianship, music recommendation and so on and deals with the question how we can utilize artificial intelligence to make music (and produce other sounds like voices) in a way that can help us solve these tasks. As examples of such AI applications the speaker introduces AI models such as an AI composer, AI performer (dancer), AI speech generation, AI singers and more. In general, the talk focuses heavily on giving a broad overview over the field and does not go into too much depth for each individual topic.

# less than 100 words
    - Sound is often visually grounded and we are able to filter out background noise and focus on a single source of sound quite easily
    - Introduces various tasks such as music identification, musical source separation, machine musicianship, music recommendation etc.
    - How can we use AI to make music?
    - Introduces applications such as AI composer, AI performer, AI speech, AI singers

Strong Points:
The talk gives an overview over a large field and mentions a large number of different tasks and applications. It is a good introduction to the topic and gives the listener an idea of what kind of applications of AI exist in the areas of music and sound while not requiring too much background knowledge. The speaker has a good utilization of multimedia and graphics and gives many example audio clips of music or sound generated by AI systems.

    # less than 100 words
    - Many examples for all kinds of generations tasks related to music, sound and speech
    - Good use of multimedia and graphics

Weak Points:
Unfortunately it was hard to listen to the audio clips of the AI-generated music and sound on the livestream as the clips were extremely noisy and difficult to hear. The presentation was somewhat superficial and not in-depth and seemed to only scrape on the surface of many of the topics discussed. I felt like the talk could have focused on a few less applications and went into a little more depth on how these systems are actually designed and trained rather than mentioning as many applications as possible. 

# less than 100 words
    - Example audio clips were very noisy and hard to hear on the livestream unfortunately
    - Not very in-depth
    - Provides merely an overview but not many details on how the methods are actually trained etc.
