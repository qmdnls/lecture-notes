Abstract:
# less than 100 words
In this talk the speaker presents results and backgrounds for two papers that deal with dialogue systems. The first paper presented, after reviewing related work, focuses on improving the consistency in dialogue models: agents often will forget important details talked about as they attend to reply with the most likely answer in a context. By using an imaginary listener that forces the dialogue system to keep its persona this can be overcome. The second paper focuses on integrating knowledge into dialogue. He presents a sequential latent model for knowledge selection in dialogue (sequential knowledge transformer). 


    Two papers:

    - Improve consistency of dialogue models without annotated training
        - Consistency problem in dialogue agents: agents will forget important details already talked about as they tend to reply with the most likely answer for a given context so there can be inconsistencies throughout the dialogue
        - Reviewing previous works tackling consistency in dialogue
        - Look at consistency from the view point of humans: we control our own consistency, we are aware of ourselves.
        - Idea: use an imaginary listener

    - Knowledge-grounded dialogue:
        - Sequential latent model for knowledge selection in dialogue
        - How do we know which knowledge to select from all the available knowledge?
        - Difficulty: rather than a single fact, many known facts may be relevant for the answer as well as the dialog history
        - Sequential Knowledge Transformer: knowledge selectrion treated as a 

Strong Points:
# less than 100 words
The talk was well-prepared and had very clear and concise slides. The speaker explained everything very clearly and in detail which understanding the material better. Relevant prior work was reviewed. Overall, the speaker presented interesting contributions to an interesting topic.

- Nice slides, clear explanations, review of relevant prior work, interesting topic with interesting contributions


Weak Points:
Unfortunately, the time management was not great so most of the talk focused on the first paper and the speaker began to run out of time by the time he started on the second paper. Due to this the presentation for this second paper felt a bit rushed and no details were given or explained beyond the basic idea.

    # less than 100 words

Abstract:
In spite of the common assumption made during the design of many cryptosystems, secrets are not manipulated in closed and reliable computing environments. Instead, existing hardware may leak information about operations which can be used to retrieve the secrets under certain circumstances. Such an attack is known as a side-channel attack. In this talk the speaker gives a historic overview over how such attacks have developed over the past two decades and gives some concrete examples of them. Lastly, the speaker explains some potential counter-measures against side-channel attacks. 

    # less than 100 words
    - in spite of assumptions made during creation of many cryptosystems, secrets are not manipulated in closed, reliable computing environemnts. existing hardware leaks information about operations that may be used to retrieve the circuits under certain circumstances. this is called a side-channel attack.
    - analysing external factors during cryptographic computations
    - overview over the history of side-channel attacks and their development over the past two decades
    - explanation of counter-measures

Strong Points:
The talk included a nice and useful overview over the history which I thought added some valuable background information. The speaker included many visualizations which helped better the understanding of the topic. Overall I found the presentation easy to follow as the speaker gave intuitive explanations of the intricacies of side-channel attacks and included many good examples which helped aid understanding (along with the visualizations mentioned).

    # less than 100 words
    - overview over the history
    - many visualizations
    - easy to follow, intuitive explanations of the intricacies of side-channel attacks, good examples that aid understanding

Weak Points:
The presentation start ended being delayed to some technical problems unfortunately and there was not really any communication to the people following along on Zoom as to what was going on. Once the presentation had started these issues seemed to have been resolved however. Additionally, the slides were not very appealing visually and looked rather dated; although they included many visualizations.

Title : [서울대 AI 콜로퀴움] Machine Musicianship: When AI meets music

Speaker : Kyogu Lee

Place: Youtube livestream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGJHpQHD6lw)

Seminar Date/Time : 2020/10/08, 17:00 ~ 18:00

Submitted Date: 2020/10/08 

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr
Abstract:
In this talk the speaker introduces various tasks related to sound and music such as music identification, musical source separation, machine musicianship, music recommendation and so on and deals with the question how we can utilize artificial intelligence to make music (and produce other sounds like voices) in a way that can help us solve these tasks. As examples of such AI applications the speaker introduces AI models such as an AI composer, AI performer (dancer), AI speech generation, AI singers and more. In general, the talk focuses heavily on giving a broad overview over the field and does not go into too much depth for each individual topic.

# less than 100 words
    - Sound is often visually grounded and we are able to filter out background noise and focus on a single source of sound quite easily
    - Introduces various tasks such as music identification, musical source separation, machine musicianship, music recommendation etc.
    - How can we use AI to make music?
    - Introduces applications such as AI composer, AI performer, AI speech, AI singers

Strong Points:
The talk gives an overview over a large field and mentions a large number of different tasks and applications. It is a good introduction to the topic and gives the listener an idea of what kind of applications of AI exist in the areas of music and sound while not requiring too much background knowledge. The speaker has a good utilization of multimedia and graphics and gives many example audio clips of music or sound generated by AI systems.

    # less than 100 words
    - Many examples for all kinds of generations tasks related to music, sound and speech
    - Good use of multimedia and graphics

Weak Points:
Unfortunately it was hard to listen to the audio clips of the AI-generated music and sound on the livestream as the clips were extremely noisy and difficult to hear. The presentation was somewhat superficial and not in-depth and seemed to only scrape on the surface of many of the topics discussed. I felt like the talk could have focused on a few less applications and went into a little more depth on how these systems are actually designed and trained rather than mentioning as many applications as possible. 

# less than 100 words
    - Example audio clips were very noisy and hard to hear on the livestream unfortunately
    - Not very in-depth
    - Provides merely an overview but not many details on how the methods are actually trained etc.

Title : Deep Unsupervised Learning of Language Structure (SNU Data Science Seminar)

Speaker : Yoon Kim

Place: Zoom (https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/88348364954)

Seminar Date/Time : 2020/10/14, 9:00 ~ 10:08

Submitted Date: 2020/10/14 

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr
Abstract:
The speaker presents recent work on deep unsupervised learning of language structure. In particularly human language understanding models can often benefit from a deeper understanding of syntactic structure. This is important because syntactic understanding of sentences influences meaning. While human learners can easily learn structure and manage to generalize to new words, this is not the case for deep learning models. The focus of the talk lies on grammar induction and formal grammars for unsupervised parsing. The speaker introduces a model from his own research, specifically a neural model which learns to predict PCFG (probabilistic context-free grammar) structure.

# less than 100 words
    - Human language understanding can benefit from a deeper understanding of syntactic structure
    - Human learners can easily learn structure in language without explicit supervision and manage to generalize to new words
    - Focus of the talk on grammar induction, that is, the unsupervised learning of syntax
    - Syntactic understanding of sentences influences meaning
    - Formal grammars for unsupervised parsing, learn to predict these grammars accurately to improve understanding
    - Introduces neural model that learns to predict PCFG (probabilistic context-free grammar) structure

Strong Points:
The speaker makes some great points and gives very in-detail explanations and insights of his research topic. It is easy to tell that the speaker is very knowledgeable in this area and he manages to explain his research in an in-depth but very understandable way. For the topics discussed the speaker gives a good intuition of the "why". The talk has a good mix of high-level explanations of the research works and details of how everything actually works. The slides include nice visualizations of syntactic trees etc.

    # less than 100 words
    - Great in-detail explanations and insights
    - Speaker gives a good intuition of the "why"
    - Good mix of high-level explanations of the works and details of how everything is done
    - Very good visualizations of syntactic trees etc. that aid understanding of the material
    

Weak Points:
The speaker could have possibly included some more in-depth outlook on the future for this research field and in particularly to practical applications of this research. It would be nice to hear some insight on how these models may be further developed or incorporated into real-world systems. Some of this was adressed during QA however. Overall it was a great, solid talk that did not have a lot of weak points.

# less than 100 words
    - Could have possibly included some more in-depth future outlook in the talk on how these models may be further developed/incorporated/deployed, but some of this was addressed during QA
    - Connection issues (speaker isn't really to blame), but well managed
    - Great talk, overall solid and not a lot of weak points!

Title : AI for All: Enabling Participatory and Procedurally-Fair AI (SNU Data Science Seminar)

Speaker : Min Kyung Lee

Place: Zoom (https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/89048786837)

Seminar Date/Time : 2020/10/21, 9:00 ~ 10:02

Submitted Date: 2020/10/26 

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr

Abstract:
The speaker gives an introduction to AI fairness with a focus on the perception of the AI and how we can improve that perception and design more fair AI systems. As AI is integrated into society and used to make more important decisions in daily life, AI should be people centered. However, there is a lack of research surrounding the psychological and societal impact of AI. The speaker introduces two lines of research they have been working on: 1) What makes AI unfair and untrustworthy to people? 2) How can we design fair and trustworthy AI systems?

    # less than 100 words
    - As AI is integrated into society and used to make more important decisions, AI should be people centered
    - Lack of research surrounding the psychological and societal impact of AI
    - Difficult to align AI with the values of society
    - 2 lines of research: What makes AI unfair and untrustworthy? How to make AI fair and trustworthy?
    - People have to understand and participate in the building of algorithms and models to trust them!
    - WeBuildAI: Collective participatory framework

Strong Points:
The research topics presented are interesting and introduced in an easily understandable manner. The speaker gives a good overview over the topics and the general structure of the talk made it very easy to follow along even with no prior knowledge in these fields. Explanations of research results were communicated in a very clear manner. The speaker also gave good responses to questions during the QA session. Overall, it was a very interesting and strong talk that can be recommended to anyone who wants an introduction to the design of fair AI systems. 

    # less than 100 words
    - Interesting research topic
    - Good overview and general structure made it very easy to follow along
    - Very clear explanations of research results
    - Good responses to questions during QA 

Weak Points:
The talk could have possibly included more of an outlook on future work as well as what we was researchers and engineers can actively do to build more trustworthy AI systems right now. Overwall however, it was a strong talk and there were no real weak points.

    # less than 100 words
    - Maybe more of a outlook on future work, what we as researchers/engineers can actively do to build more trustworthy AI systems right now

Weak Points:

    # less than 100 words
    - Talk felt more like an advertisement for an NCSOFT and their PAIGE baseball app than it was informative
    - Presentation style felt a bit monotonous
    - While many examples of applications were given it would have been nice to have some case study of single examples that are examined closer, i.e. rather than listing all areas where AI has been used, it would be nice to hear more about this was done, how the experience was, what challenges were encountered

Title : A Unified Architecture for Simple and Fast Deep Learning

Speaker : Eunji Jeong (advisor professor : Byung Gon Jeon)

Place: Zoom (https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/83470489890)

Seminar Date/Time : 2020/11/05, 14:00 ~ 14:40

Submitted Date: 2020/11/05

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr

Abstract:
There are two main paradigms in deep learning with major frameworks for each of them: symbolic and imperative deep learning frameworks. While imperative frameworks allow for more intuitive programming and debugging, symbolic frameworks are more straightforward to optimize and allow parallel execution of operations. In this PhD thesis presentation, the speaker introduces a framework unifying these two paradigms and allowing intuitive imperative programming with nearly the same speed as symbolic frameworks provide by using speculative graph generation and optimization.
    # less than 100 words

Strong Points:
The speaker presents a novel and very interesting approach. Explanations of this approach and the ideas behind it are very intuitive and the clear slides aid understanding and make it very easy to follow along. The slides are very clean and graphics help where needed as well. The speaker speaks very clearly. Overall, the talk is strong and gives a great overview over this line of research.
    # less than 100 words

Weak Points:
The talk is split into three main sections that correspond to research papers published and these papers are presented more or less independently of one another instead of connecting the ideas and thoughts behind this line of research more thoroughly. A clear overview over what we will see in this talk in the beginning is missing and would have been helpful for following along.

Submitted Date: 2020/11/06

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr

Abstract:
The speaker introduces a novel architecture for distributed data processing that is more efficient and flexible than existing architectures. In particular the proposed architecture supports flexible optimizations for different use cases. The speaker compares their Apache Nemo architecture to existing works in the field and shows how limitations are overcome. Furthermore, several example use cases as well as a detailed evaluation of this approach is given. 
    # less than 100 words

Strong Points:
The talk is structured very well and the structure makes it easier to follow along. Especially the overview over existing works and what limitations are being tackled specifically made it easy to understand the benefits of the proposed approach. The explanations given were good and clear. The speaker spoke very clearly throughout the talk.
    # less than 100 words

Weak Points:
The slides could be more clear; most slides do not include any text and only figures which makes it harder to follow along, especially since slides are "layered", that is, annotations "pop up" on top of the figures thus occluding what was underneath.

Title : Exploiting Semi-Structured Data for In-Database Query Processing and Machine Learning

Speaker : Wolfgang Lehner

Place: Zoom (https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/6232699248)

Submitted Date: 2020/11/16

Submitter: BEBENSEE BJOERN / 2019-21343 / bebensee@snu.ac.kr

Abstract:
Although text data and semi-structured data are widely available and their use has been on the rise in recent years (especially with breakthroughs in NLP) relational data still dominates the market and remains most relevant. The speaker gives an introduction to his research on incorporating this semi-structured text data to relational databases. One example out of the works presented in this talk is their FREDDY framework, incorporating word embeddings to database systems and allowing grouping data by their semantic relationships, i.e. through a kNN-join over the embedded texts.
    # less than 100 words
    - text data and semi-structured data on the rise
    - however: relational data still the most relevant, still dominates the market
    - idea: combine relational database with text data and a word embedding 
    - FREDDY: Fast Word Embeddings in Database Systems
    - allows grouping of data by semantic relationships in databases, i.e. kNN-join
    - word embeddings can't capture context-specific semantics!
    - retrofitting
    - evaluation

Strong Points:
The speaker introduces an interesting topic and gives an overview over their recent research. It is clear that the speaker is very knowledgeable and he gives valuable insights. Throughout the talk the speaker gives helpful annotations and highlights using a pen directly on the slides. The talk is logically well-organized. Overall, I think the talk is good for people seeking an introduction to this area of research as the speaker gives a relatively broad overview.
    # less than 100 words
    - very interesting topic
    - helpful annotations and highlights with pen on the slides during talk
    - large overview over research area

Weak Points:
Although the speaker is clearly very knowledgeable (or maybe because of this) explanations in some places are lacking and details are glossed over. In generall the slides are somewhat disconnected from the talk and the speaker talks about things not seen on the slides and does not mention many things that are shown on the slides which makes it harder to follow along.
    # less than 100 words
