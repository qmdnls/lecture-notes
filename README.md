# Lecture notes

A compilation of lecture notes and homework assignments for courses I have taken. These notes are not official nor have they been proofread by the instructor of each class. These notes may contain errors or typos. If you encounter such an error I would greatly appreciate it if you could open a pull request or open an issue so I can fix it.
