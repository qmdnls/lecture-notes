Data mining attracted much interests as an essential tool for big data analysis. Especially, designing and implementing advanced data mining algorithms and analysis platforms play crucial roles in extracting executable knowledges from big data. This course covers advanced data mining techniques, algorithms, and core platforms for big data analysis. This course also covers the techniques to effectively analyze very large data and high-speed data.
A very important aspect of this course is the course project. Students will pick an interesting data mining project, and do data mining researches on the topic. At the end of the course, students will learn how to do interesting researches in data mining, and how to write good papers.

Your final grade for the course will be determined by
$$
10\% \text{ attendance} + 20\% \text{ homework} + 20\% \text{ midterm} + 20\% \text{ final} + 30\% \text{ project}.
