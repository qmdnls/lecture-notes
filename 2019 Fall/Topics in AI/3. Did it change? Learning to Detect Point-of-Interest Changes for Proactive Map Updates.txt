In our modern society maps are of increasing importance as many people utilize the maps provided by their smartphones to navigate in every day life. However, these maps are still largely updated manually which is a very time-consuming process. Revaud, Heo, Rezende, You, Jeong propose a method to automatically detect changes in points of interests (POIs) from geo-tagged street-view images which can allow maps to be updated much more proactively as a step towards fully-automated map maintenance. The task at hand is challenging as images of the same POI may vary widely due to different viewpoints, noise and lighting and even if the POI does not change it is possible that its appearance changes.

As part of their work they release a dataset of geo-localized images of POIs captured in indoor shopping malls. The dataset was collected in two in-door shopping malls. It includes many different viewpoints for the 578 POIs and each geo-localized image additionally contains 6-DoF camera pose information. There are two main tasks in POI change detection. First, one has to determine a function that can predict the similarity between two images $d \in D^t$ and $d' \in D'^{t'}$ where $D$ and $D'$ are geo-localized datasets and where the time $t' > t$. Once these POIs are identified, one wants to determine a POI change scoring function which subsequently scores images of the same POI to predict whether it has changed (for any reason).

To learn the similarity function Revaud et al. learn an embedding function $f(I) = x \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ and define the ground truth such that two images are only similar when they show the same POI (at least partially). The POI scoring function is implemented by max-pooling pairwise similarity scores so that a POI change is predicted when no pair of images of the same location is similar. To predict POI changes one only needs to learn the embedding function now.
